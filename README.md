I use this repository to keep track of my progress while learning the C programming language, and to store the files I create in that process.

The repository contains an "Exercises" folder which stores all of the exercises I have completed.
This folder also contains two C files I use as scratchpaper, a notes file, and the a.exe file.

There is, lastly, a shortcut file that opens up the textbook if the user has the respective PDF file and it is stored in the right location.
